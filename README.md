## Knights and Knaves Logic Puzzle Solver

This project solves Knights and Knaves logic puzzles using propositional logic. Each character in the puzzles is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a knave, who always lies. The program encodes statements as logical formulas and uses a model-checking approach to determine each characterâ€™s identity.
